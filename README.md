# c-_projects
In this repository, I'll be posting some projects made by me while learning and working on c++.
curl_source_code.c++ program copies the source code of a website which is entered by the user and saves it into the file name entered by the user on his current directory.
This program can be helpful for those developers who are trying to make a clone of a website.
Atlast, anyone can use this program for ethical usages ( not to create phishing websites I mean ).
